# DualTul
Hivetul code on dual scale system

This time trying to keep all my code on the usb drive.

Installation notes - 
clone all of this code to the external drive which you have mapped to:
/media/usbstick/www
and yes, you guessed - this will be the web page directory, too.
edit your Apache2 configuration so that that directory is the index directory.
rename the datafile sample to data0.csv.
You should be able to pull up the sample data from the address

The data aquire. code has not been fully fleshed out in this upload - since you need hardware configured to make that work, it will come in a little bit.
